                <div class="text">
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Created a scalable module that can be used for rapid
                            text based search and can handle a large amount of
                            data without a significant drop in response time.
                            Used <strong>Elasticsearch</strong> as a database
                            and <strong>Django</strong> as the backend of the
                            module.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Created an API that searches the database for
                            relevant results based on criteria pre-determined by
                            the business team. Optimized the response time of
                            the API with the help of <strong>Redis</strong>, a
                            key-value cache database.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Created a "Product Addition" module which takes a
                            url as an input and scrapes the resulting webpage
                            and stores the information required into the
                            database. Utilized this module to automatically add
                            thousands of products into the database from
                            partnered vendors like Pepperfry, Urbanladder, Asian
                            Paints etc.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Optimized the backend code and removed unnecessary
                            database calls and improved the response times of
                            several APIs
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Created a tool which acts as a 'lightweight' version
                            of the company's main product. It was created
                            because the main product was not easily scalable and
                            robust and would take time to process inputs. The
                            lightweight version will process inputs faster but
                            will be less accurate than the main product and can
                            be easily scaled up to handle a growing userbase.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Extended the main product and the lightweight
                            version by adding a feature which allows users to
                            change wallcolors and apply wallpapers.

                            precise rotational movements into precise
                            translational movements. This product helps blind

                            designed in a way that makes it easy to mass produce
