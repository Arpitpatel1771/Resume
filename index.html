                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Created a scalable module that can be used for rapid text based search and can handle a large amount of data without a significant drop in response time. Used <strong>Elasticsearch</strong> as a database and <strong>Django</strong> as the backend of the module.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Created an API that searches the database for relevant results based on criteria pre-determined by the business team. Optimized the response time of the API with the help of <strong>Redis</strong>, a key-value cache database.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Created a "Product Addition" module which takes a url as an input and scrapes the resulting webpage and stores the information required into the database. Utilized this module to automatically add thousands of products into the database from partnered vendors like Pepperfry, Urbanladder, Asian Paints etc.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Optimized the backend code and removed unnecessary database calls and improved the response times of several APIs
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Created a tool which acts as a 'lightweight' version of the company's main product. It was created because the main product was not easily scalable and robust and would take time to process inputs. The lightweight version will process inputs faster but will be less accurate than the main product and can be easily scaled up to handle a growing userbase.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Extended the main product and the lightweight version by adding a feature which allows users to change wallcolors and apply wallpapers.
                        </li>

                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Used <strong>Django</strong> and <strong>Django REST Framework</strong> to write the business logic and handle the backend of the application
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Helped with rigging of 3D models and animating the models with the help of blender and three.js
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Helped with the creation of a three.js based environment which allows users to experience the Metaverse without having to buy a VR headset. The Metaverse is rendered in the browser itself and allows users to interact with other users with the help of audio and video as well as a dedicated text based chat window
